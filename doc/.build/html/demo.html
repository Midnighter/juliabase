<h1>A walk through JuliaBase<a class="headerlink" href="#a-walk-through-juliabase" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<div class="section" id="the-demo-site">
<span id="index-0"></span><h2>The demo site<a class="headerlink" href="#the-demo-site" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>At <a class="reference external" href="https://demo.juliabase.org">https://demo.juliabase.org</a>, a demo of JuliaBase is installed so that you can
play with it a little bit.  You can log in with various accounts with different
levels of permissions, add samples, processes, tasks etc., have a look at
sample data sheets or a lab notebook, and much more.</p>
<p>However, since this site is accessable to everyone, it may become chaotic over
time.  In order to prevent that, all the data is reset every hour on the
hour.  So, don&#8217;t be surprised if you have to log in again after some time – all
session data is reset, too.  There is nothing to worry though as you may log
in as often as you wish.</p>
<p>This demo site is also the default target of the remote client code shipped
with JuliaBase.  You are encouraged to use the demo as a test bed for your
client code.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-demo-accounts">
<h2>The demo accounts<a class="headerlink" href="#the-demo-accounts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The demo site is the JuliaBase installation of the “Institute of Nifty New
Materials” (INM).  It&#8217;s a very small institute with only six employees.  All
accounts have the password “12345”.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-boss">
<span id="index-1"></span><h3>The boss<a class="headerlink" href="#the-boss" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>Sean Renard</strong> (s.renard) is the lead scientist and director of this
institute.  Accordingly, his JuliaBase account allows him to view all samples,
but he has got other privileges, too.  More about that later.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-technical-staff">
<h3>The technical staff<a class="headerlink" href="#the-technical-staff" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>Nick Burkhardt</strong> (n.burkhardt) is a technician in the INM for a very long time.  He is
responsible for the <em>PDS setup</em> (photothermal deflection spectroscopy), a
measurement setup.  He performs measurements for researchers.  He would never
let another person use his PDS.</p>
<p><strong>Hank Griffin</strong> (h.griffin) is also a technician.  He is responsible for the
<em>solarsimulator</em>, another measurement setup.  He performs measurements for
researchers, but after proper instructions by him, other people may use the
apparatus, too.</p>
<p><strong>Eddie Monroe</strong> (e.monroe) is a deposition operator.  This is a technician who
manages a deposition system, in his case, the <em>cluster tool deposition</em>.  Here
too, other institute members may use this system after proper instructions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-scientific-staff">
<h3>The scientific staff<a class="headerlink" href="#the-scientific-staff" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong>Rosalee Calvert</strong> (r.calvert) is a tenure scientist and creates samples by
herself in the <em>5-chamber deposition setup</em>.  Currently, she&#8217;s the only one
using this setup.  Afterwards, she measures the samples in the solarsimulator.
His current project is a cooperation with the University of Paris.</p>
<p><strong>Juliette Silverton</strong> (j.silverton) is a PhD student with a lot of work.
Thus, she is unable to do sample preparation and measurements herself, and let
others do it.  Consequently, she makes intensive use of JuliaBase&#8217;s “task
lists” feature in order to commission the work.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rosalee-the-everyday-work">
<h2>Rosalee: The everyday work<a class="headerlink" href="#rosalee-the-everyday-work" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/ss_main.png"><img alt="Main menu screenshot" class="align-right" src="_images/ss_main.png" style="width: 427.0px; height: 323.0px;" /></a>
<p>Log in as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">r.calvert</span></tt>, the typical ordinary user.  We will see how she gets
her work done.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-my-samples-list">
<span id="index-2"></span><h3>The “My Samples” list<a class="headerlink" href="#the-my-samples-list" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In the main menu, you can see Rosalee&#8217;s “My Samples” on the right hand side.
This list usually contains not <em>all</em> samples of a user but only those that are
<em>currently of interest</em> to him/her.  Still, this list may become quite long,
and is therefore structured by <em>topics</em> and <em>sample series</em>.  You may click on
the bullet icons (<img alt="group icon" src="_images/group.png" /> or <img alt="sample series icon" src="_images/chart_organisation.png" />) in the list to fold and
unfold sections that you want to hide.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="topics">
<span id="index-3"></span><h3>Topics<a class="headerlink" href="#topics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>One sample usually belongs to exactly one topic.  This helps to organise
samples.  For one thing, one can give topics expressive names, which makes the
samples&#8217; purpose clear.  In Rosalee&#8217;s list, all samples belong to the topic
“Cooperation with Paris University”.</p>
<p id="index-4">But even more important is that topics define who can see the sample.  The
prime directive in JuliaBase is: <em>You can only see samples of your topics.</em></p>
<p>If a sample is in no topic, it is completely unprotected.  Everyone can see it
and take possession of it.  There may be use cases for that but usually, you
should put all your samples in topics.</p>
<p>People can be in an arbitrary lot of topics at the same time, but a sample is
in exactly one topic.  It may change it during its lifetime, though.  Senior
team members may have the permission to see all samples, whether in their
topics or not.  Sean Renard is such a person.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sample-data-sheet">
<span id="index-5"></span><h3>Sample data sheet<a class="headerlink" href="#sample-data-sheet" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/ss_datasheet.png"><img alt="Sample data sheet screenshot" class="align-right" src="_images/ss_datasheet.png" style="width: 419.5px; height: 938.5px;" /></a>
<p>Let&#8217;s visit a sample by clicking on “14S-001”.  You see its data sheet.  At the
top, it contains some general information like the currently responsible person
and the topic.  Then, you see a list of everything that has been done with this
sample, in chronological order.  It starts with the substrate, is continued
with the deposition of the silicon layers, and ends with a measurement in the
solar simulator.</p>
<p id="index-6">Every such step is called a “process” in JuliaBase.  Even the “Substrate” is a
process, albeit a slightly odd one.  Every process has an operator and a
timestamp.  You can fold processes that would otherwise clobber the data sheet
by clicking on the heading.</p>
<p>The main work when adapting JuliaBase to a new institute is programming all the
processes that the institute needs.  The solarsimulator measurement at the
bottom is a good example why it is worth the effort.  Just click on the colored
squares, and you see how the data and the plot change immediately.  Such
features are lacking in off-the-shelf databases.  This high degree of
adaptability and flexibility is the primary strength of JuliaBase.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s scroll back to the top.  You see a schematic cross section of the sample,
called an “informal stack” because it may not be totally accurate.  This is not
part of JuliaBase&#8217;s core because it may not be useful for every institute.  But
it&#8217;s part of the source code and you may use it.  If you click on it, you get
it as a PDF.  This is also true for all plots in JuliaBase.</p>
<span class="target" id="index-7"></span></div>
<div class="section" id="edit-samples">
<h3>Edit samples<a class="headerlink" href="#edit-samples" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>You can edit a sample by clicking on the pencil icon <img alt="pencil icon" src="_images/pencil.png" /> next to the
sample&#8217;s name.  “Editing a sample” refers <em>only</em> to the data at the top of the
data sheet.  In particular, no processes are affected.  Very often when you
change somethin in JuliaBase, you have to describe your changes shortly at the
bottom right.  It may be tedious sometimes, but it may be very helpful to
others who get notified by your changes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="add-processes">
<h3>Add processes<a class="headerlink" href="#add-processes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Also on the top of the sample data sheet there is the gear icon <img alt="gear add icon" src="_images/cog_add.png" />, which is to append a new process to the sample.  If you click on it, you
are asked which kind of process you&#8217;d like to add.  Let&#8217;s have a look at two
possibilities: Splitting and result process.</p>
<div class="section" id="split-a-sample">
<span id="index-8"></span><h4>Split a sample<a class="headerlink" href="#split-a-sample" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>If you split samples into pieces, you surely want to keep track of that.  For
doing so, you click on the gear icon <img alt="gear add icon" src="_images/cog_add.png" /> and select “sample split”.
Then, you can enter the new names of the samples.  Usually, they extend their
parent&#8217;s name.  When looking at a sample&#8217;s data sheet, you also see all
processes of the parents.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="result-process">
<span id="index-9"></span><h4>Result process<a class="headerlink" href="#result-process" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Result processes, often simply called “result”, are a handy ad-hoc way to
append something to a sample&#8217;s data sheet.  If you want to add a measurement
result for which no dedicated process has been programmed so far, or if you
want to add a plot, a picture, or a comment, then create a result.  It&#8217;s the
Swiss-Army-knife process if nothing else fits.  Because it&#8217;s so flexible, be
careful not to have spelling errors in order to keep searching and exporting
easy.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="advanced-search">
<span id="index-10"></span><h3>Advanced search<a class="headerlink" href="#advanced-search" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/ss_advanced_search.png"><img alt="Advanced search screenshot" class="align-right" src="_images/ss_advanced_search.png" style="width: 420.5px; height: 539.0px;" /></a>
<p>Rosalee wants to see her best samples.  For this, go back to the main menu (the
house icon <img alt="house icon" src="_images/house.png" /> on the top right, or the big text “Samples”) and select
“Search for things – Advanced search”.  Now, perform the following steps,
clicking on “Submit” after each step:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Select “sample” in the drop down menu.</li>
<li>Enter “calvert” in “currently responsible person” and select “solarsimulator
measurement” in the drop-down menu “containing”.</li>
<li>Select “AM1.5” in “irradiation”, and select “solarsimulator cell
measurement” in the inner drop-down menu “containing”.</li>
<li>Enter in “efficiency η“ the value “8”.</li>
</ol>
<p>You get the result as in the image next to this text: Two of her samples match
the criteria, namely “14S-002” and “14S-003”.  This means, both samples have at
least one solarsimulator measurement under AM&nbsp;1.5 irradiation, with at least
one cell with an efficiency greater than 8%.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">You may bookmark advanced searches and revisit them as often as you wish.
Every time, you get new results for your old search criteria.</p>
</div>
<div style="clear: both"/></div>
<div class="section" id="data-export">
<span id="index-11"></span><h3>Data export<a class="headerlink" href="#data-export" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/ss_csv_export.png"><img alt="CSV export screenshot" class="align-right" src="_images/ss_csv_export.png" style="width: 419.5px; height: 330.5px;" /></a>
<p>Rosalee needs the data in her spreadsheet program.  So, click yet another time
on “Submit”.  You may select the processes on the sample data sheet that should
be included into the output.  Select the second layer of the 5-chamber
deposition and the first solarsimulator measurement.  Click on “Submit”.  Now,
you may select the fields of these processes that should be included into the
output.  Select “<span class="math">\(\mathrm{SiH}_4\)</span>/sccm” (the silane flux, by the way) of
the layer and “η of best cell/%” of the solarsimulator measurement.  Click on
“Submit”.</p>
<p>The result is shown in the screenshot.  The table comprises all the data that
will be included into the output.  Click one last time on “Submit”, and you can
download that table as a CSV file ready-to-be-opened with your favourite
spreadsheet program.  When opening it, take care that columns are separated
<em>only</em> by tabstops.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="add-samples">
<span id="index-12"></span><h3>Add samples<a class="headerlink" href="#add-samples" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>From the main menu, you can click on “Add things – Samples” to add samples.
Note that this page is quite institute-specific.  Your institute may not have
the concept of substrates, for example, and surely not something like a
“cleaning number”.  Anyway, you must enter the number of samples as well as
their current location.  Add a couple of samples, but don&#8217;t rename them yet.</p>
<p>Fresh samples have a provisional name in JuliaBase.  It looks like “*00034”,
i.e., an asterisk followed by a five-digit number.  Never use these names on
sample boxes or in lab notebooks.  They are meant to be replaced by a real name
as quickly as possible.  Rosalee&#8217;s samples get their names after the first
deposition of silicon, so let&#8217;s do that now.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="lab-notebooks">
<span id="index-13"></span><h3>Lab notebooks<a class="headerlink" href="#lab-notebooks" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>From the main menu, open the lab notebook of the five-chamber deposition.  You
see six depositions of October&nbsp;2014.  Select one of them.  JuliaBase shows you
a page containing the details of only this deposition.  At the top of it, click
on the gear icon <img alt="gear add icon" src="_images/cog_add.png" /> in order to duplicate this deposition.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="add-new-deposition-process">
<h3>Add new deposition process<a class="headerlink" href="#add-new-deposition-process" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Rosalee duplicates old depositions because she doesn&#8217;t vary much.  This way,
she adds new depositions without fuss.  In the page for the new deposition, she
only has to select the samples for the deposition (which are the samples
recently added, with these “*…” names), change some other things that were
different in this run, and click on “Submit”.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/ss_rename_after_depo.png"><img alt="Rename after deposition screenshot" class="align-right" src="_images/ss_rename_after_depo.png" style="width: 428.0px; height: 277.0px;" /></a>
<p>Now, its a habit in the Institute of Nifty New Materials to give the sample the
same name as the deposition.  Therefore, immediately after having added the
deposition, you are redirected to a page where you can check and change the new
sample names.  JuliaBase suggests the deposition&#8217;s name for all samples (in the
case of the screenshot, three of them).  However, names must be unique, so
Rosalee appends “…-a”, “…-b”, and&nbsp;“…-c” (see screenshot, second column).  Click
on “Submit”, that&#8217;s it!  The newly deposited samples appear with their proper
names under “My Samples” on the main menu page.</p>
<p>Of course, your institute may have another workflow without such renaming,
which is a bad idea anyway – names in a database should never change.  So you
can just leave out the renaming page in your own code.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="change-permissions-for-processes">
<span id="permissions-to-processes"></span><span id="index-14"></span><h3>Change permissions for processes<a class="headerlink" href="#change-permissions-for-processes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

<p>As already mentioned, Rosalee is responsible for the 5-chamber deposition
setup.  But let&#8217;s assume Eddie wants to do such depositions, too, and gets an
introduction?  Then, he should also be allowed to add such depositions to
JuliaBase.</p>
<p>Rosalee visits “Miscellaneous – Permissions to processes” from the main menu,
selects Eddie from the drop-down menu and clicks on “Submit”.  She puts tick
marks into the first two checkboxes and clicks again on “Submit”.  Now Eddie
has got the following additional permissions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>He can add new 5-chamber depositions.</li>
<li>He can edit his own 5-chamber depositions (those that he&#8217;s the operator of).</li>
<li>He can view all 5-chamber depositions.  In particular, this implies that he
can view the lab notebook.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="claims-of-samples">
<span id="index-15"></span><h3>Claims of samples<a class="headerlink" href="#claims-of-samples" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There is one of Juliette&#8217;s samples that Rosalee wants to acquire possession of.
In principle, Juliette could set the sample&#8217;s “currently responsible person” to
Rosalee, but Juliette is reluctant to do work that also other could do (more on
that later).</p>
<p>Moreover, sometimes you must acquire possesion of orphaned samples; or of
samples that were imported as legacy data without any ownership information.
In these cases, it is really <em>necessary</em> to be able to claim samples.  This is
done in two steps.</p>

<p>Rosalee clicks on “Search for things – Samples by name” in the main menu and
enters the name “14-JS-2” into the field.  She puts a tick into the checkbox
and clicks on “add samples”.  This way, the sample 14-JS-2 is added to

<p>Next, Rosalee visits “Miscellaneous – Sample claims” from the main menu, and on
the next page, selects “existing samples”.  Here, she selects 14-JS-2, and
“Sean Renard” as the reviewer of the claim (he&#8217;s the only choice anyway).
That&#8217;s it.  The next page lets Rosalee review the claim.  But now she has to
wait for Sean (who got an automatic email) for approving it.</p>

<p>Let us assume Juliette wants to have a PDS measurement for her sample 14-JS-1.
Therefore, visit “Miscellaneous – Task lists” from the main menu.  There,
first set up the page by selecting the processes that you&#8217;re interested in.
Select “PDS measurements” and click on “Submit”.</p>
<p>Now you add a new task for the PDS setup by clicking on the plus icon <img alt="layout add icon" src="_images/layout_add.png" /> for PDS measurements.  Select the sample 14-JS-1, click on “Submit”
and you&#8217;re finished.  You can see the new task in the list of tasks.  There,
you may withdraw it by clicking on the minus icon&nbsp;<img alt="layout delete icon" src="_images/layout_delete.png" />, or edit
it by clicking on the pencil icon&nbsp;<img alt="layout edit icon" src="_images/layout_edit.png" />.</p>

<p>Juliette wants to show the sample 14-JS-1 to Nick so that he can have a look at
it.  Of course, Nick could look for the sample himself, but since the sample is
in the topic “Juliette&#8217;s PhD thesis” and Nick isn&#8217;t, he cannot view the
sample&#8217;s data sheet.</p>
<p>To send the sample to Nick, click on the pencil icon <img alt="pencil icon" src="_images/pencil.png" /> next to “My
samples” on the main menu page.  Select the sample 14-JS-1 on the left.  Then,
on the right, select Nick in the multiple choice “Copy to user” and enter, say,
“Please have a look at this sample” at “Comment for recipient”.  Finally, set
“Clearance” to “all processes up to now”, because Juliette wants Nick to be
able to see the whole data sheet of 14-JS-1.</p>

<div class="section" id="nick-technical-service-for-others">

you can view its data sheet.  The transfer has worked.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-newsfeed">
<span id="index-17"></span><h3>The newsfeed<a class="headerlink" href="#the-newsfeed" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Moreover, Nick has been notified by the transfer in “Main menu – Miscellaneous
– Newsfeed”.  There, he can also see that Juliette has files a new task for PDS
measurements because Nick has the necessary permissions for the PDS.  The
newsfeed contains all important news for the respective user: Changes in their
samples, new samples in their topics, samples transferred to them, new tasks,
and much more.</p>
<p>The newsfeed is not really intended to be view in the browser.  You may do so,
but it is a little bit awkward.  Rather, use a program capable of RSS feeds
like Thunderbird.  It is able to show you which entries in the feed are really
new.</p>

<p>Since Nick has read that Juliette had filed a new PDS task, he visits the “Task
lists” page himself.  When doing this the first time, you have to select the
PDS and click on “Submit” to make PDS tasks viewable to Nick.</p>
<p>In general, there are more than one person working at a setup like the PDS.
Sometimes, people are absent (holidays, illness, etc).  Therefore, it is not
a-priori clear who will actually do a task, and the task must be explicitly
accepted by someone and assigned to someone.  In order to so this, click on the
pencil icon to edit it.  Set the “status” to “accepted” and “operator” to Nick
himself.  Juliette will get notified of this.</p>
<p>Nick can edit all PDS tasks by clicking on the pencil icon <img alt="layout edit icon" src="_images/layout_edit.png" />.
When Nick is actually doing the measurement, he may set the task&#8217;s status to
“in progress”, and after that, to “finished”.  A finished task may even be
connected with the concrete PDS measurement.</p>
<p>Some of these steps are optional.  It depends on your workflow.  An operator
might only set finished tasks to “finished” without further ado.  Or he may use
all of the features offered by task lists.  Or anything in between.</p>
